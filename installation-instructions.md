# What you'll need
* Java
* Leiningen, a tool for managing Clojure projects
* IntelliJ IDEA, an editor.  I will be providing examples in IntelliJ IDEA because the debugger and REPL support is quite nifty.  You are free to use other editors (Vim, Emacs) as well, but please install IDEA so that you can follow along with my examples.
* Cursive, an IDEA plugin that supports Clojure

# Installation instructions
* Please follow the [ClojureBridge instructions for installing Java](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum/blob/master/outline/setup_osx.md#making-sure-java-is-installed)
* Please follow the [ClojureBridge instructions for installing Leiningen](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum/blob/master/outline/setup_osx.md#installing-leiningen)
* The Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA is free.  You can download it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* You can find the instructions to install Cursive [here](https://cursiveclojure.com/userguide/).  

As of May 1, 2015, the current version of IDEA is 14.1, so you will use the Cursive url for 14.1 (in the section called "Installing Cursive")

Feel free to grab me if you run into trouble with the install steps.
