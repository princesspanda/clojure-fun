# clojure-fun
Intro to Clojure curriculum for Funding Circlers.  To get a general lay of the land, check out the [Intro](https://github.com/princesspanda/clojure-fun/blob/master/01-intro.md)

This is where I'll keep track of what we cover each session, so if you miss something, just look here.

# Topics Covered

## 2015-05-04
* From the ClojureBridge curriculum: Module 1, 2, and halfway through 3, ending on [this slide](http://clojurebridge.github.io/curriculum/module3.html#/6)
* From this repo: 01-intro and 02-clojure-is-simple
* Lightly touched on: 
  * macros & macro expansion as they relate to ```defn```
  * ```rest``` arguments
  * defining a function with multiple arities
  * quoted forms
  * ```conj``` and how you can call ```conj``` on a list or a vector and it'll add the new item to either the front or end of the collection depending on what type it is and what guarantees the data structure provides for insertion.
