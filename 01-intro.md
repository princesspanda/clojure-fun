# Goals & Benefits
* To provide a fun, friendly environment for learning Clojure
* It'll make it easier to move across tracks

# Logistics
* Lunch time (12:30pm - 1:30pm) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in a conference room (the room will be on the calendar invite)
* Acquire your lunch **before 12:30** so that we can start and end on time
* As long as one person is there, the show will go on!

# What You Can Expect From Me
* Each lesson will be a combination of me talking plus breaks to work through exercises
* The material will draw from the [ClojureBridge curriculum](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/curriculum) as well as [Clojure Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013754.do)
* The lesson plans will live in this repo, so feel free to refer back to the lessons if you want to review.
* As much as possible, I will try to draw on examples from FC apps

# What I Expect From You
* Ask questions!
* Have fun!
* Help each other out!  Pairing FTW!
* **Give me feedback**  We're trying something new, so we can shape the format to meet our needs.
